/**
 * Builds a [Wall] from the controller's panel layout and optional gap file.
 *
 * A cell holds a light when a panel covers it **and** the gap file does not
 * exclude it. Both halves matter: a matrix made of panels that do not fill its
 * bounding box has cells no panel reaches, and those are empty regardless of
 * what the gap file says.
 *
 * [gaps] is WLED's optional `/2d-gaps.json`: one entry per cell in the
 * matrix's bounding box, row-major. -1 means no LED is physically there and 0
 * means an LED is wired there but unusable. The app treats both as "no hold",
 * because the difference between them is only about how LED indices shift
 * along the strip - which matters to WLED's own rendering and not to anything
 * sent from here. A [gaps] list shorter than the matrix's cell count is
 * ignored entirely, matching WLED's own fallback.
 *
 * This used to port WLED's `WS2812FX::setUpMatrix()` in full, walking each
 * panel in wiring order to assign strip indices. Those indices turned out to
 * be read by nothing: per-pixel commands address grid positions. The walk, and
 * the eight tests pinning its serpentine and orientation behaviour, went with
 * them. [Panel]'s wiring flags are still parsed, because they describe the
 * controller's configuration faithfully and a future gap-file editor may need
 * to reason about them.
