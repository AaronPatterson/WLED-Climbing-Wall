 * The controller answered, but its configuration isn't a usable 2D matrix -

 *
 * Distinct from an [java.io.IOException] so callers can tell "couldn't reach
 * the controller" (check the network) apart from "reached it, but it isn't
 * set up as a wall" (check WLED's 2D config) - the two need very different
 * things from the user.
