/**
 * The climbing wall's grid: [width] x [height] cells, where each either has a
 * hold that can be lit or does not. `cells[y][x]` is true where a hold is.
 *
 * This deliberately does **not** record where each LED sits along the physical
 * strip. WLED's per-pixel `"i"` command addresses the *grid* position
 * (`x + y * width`) and applies its own ledmap when rendering, so the strip
 * order never reaches anything the app sends. Tracking it meant porting WLED's
 * serpentine and panel-orientation walk to produce numbers nothing read - see
 * the git history of [buildWall] if it is ever needed again.
