/**
 * Saved walls and the routes drawn on them.
 *
 * Version 1 is still the first schema, because none has ever been released -
 * 0.9.0 shipped without anything that opens this database. Columns added
 * before that point are folded into version 1 rather than migrated to, which
 * keeps the first published schema whole instead of arriving with a migration
 * from a version nobody ever had.
 *
 * That stops being true with the first release that writes here. From then on
 * a changed entity needs a version bump and a Migration, or Room's identity
 * hash disagrees with the file on disk, the open throws, and every saved route
 * becomes unreachable.
 *
 * Foreign keys are enabled explicitly. Room declares the constraint but SQLite
 * ignores foreign keys unless the pragma is set per connection, so without
 * this the cascade that removes a wall's routes would quietly not happen.
