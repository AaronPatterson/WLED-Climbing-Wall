/**
 * The stored wall behind a controller, created the first time one is reached.
 *
 * Routes hang off a wall row, so something has to exist before a route can be
 * saved. That happens on connect rather than on first save: a wall discovered
 * by talking to the controller is a fact, and waiting until someone saves a
 * route would mean doing this work in the middle of the one action that must
 * not fail.
 *
 * **Walls are identified by the controller's MAC**, which WLED reports as
 * `mac` on `/json/info` and takes from the chip's eFuse. It survives reboots,
 * firmware updates, renaming, and a DHCP lease putting the controller on a new
 * address - which the address itself plainly does not. The address is still
 * stored, and updated whenever the controller turns up somewhere new, so a
 * wall can be reached without rediscovery.
 *
 * There is no second way to find a wall. A controller that reports no MAC is
 * refused on connect, so the MAC is always there to look up by - and matching
 * on an address instead would hand one wall's routes to whichever controller
 * DHCP put at that address next.
 *
 * The database enforces one row per MAC. Two rows for one controller would
 * split a wall's routes across both, and whichever the app found first would
 * look like it had lost half of them - so that is a constraint rather than
 * something this class is merely careful about.
 *
 * Takes the controller's MAC and name as plain values rather than the type the
 * network layer parses them into. Storage has no business knowing the wire
 * format exists, and the two facts it actually needs are a string and a
 * nullable string.
 *
 * Shape and name are refreshed from the controller on every connect, because
 * the controller is the authority on both. [StoredWall.lastSelectedRouteId] is
 * deliberately preserved: it is the app's own state, not the controller's.
