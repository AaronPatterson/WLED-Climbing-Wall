/**
 * Master brightness, shown under the top bar while it is open.
 *
 * Drawn over the content rather than above it in the layout. Inline, opening
 * and closing this pushed the grid down and let it spring back - and since the
 * row closes on a tap, aiming at a hold moved the grid up under the finger
 * before the tap resolved, so the hold below the intended one was painted.
 * Floating costs a shadow and buys a wall that stays where it is put.
