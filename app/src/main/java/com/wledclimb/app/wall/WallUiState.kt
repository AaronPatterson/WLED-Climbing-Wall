     * [litHolds] maps a grid position (`Wall.segmentIndexAt`) to the colour it's
     * showing; holds absent from it are off. This is the route currently on the
     * wall. Keyed by grid position, not by position along the LED strip - that's
     * what WLED's per-pixel commands address.
     *
     * [selectedColor] is what the next tapped hold will be painted in.
     *
     * [brightness] is WLED's master brightness and is independent of [on]:
     * switching the wall off leaves it where it was, so both are needed to
     * describe the wall rather than either alone.
     *
     * [wallId] is the row this wall was stored as, and is null when storing it
     * failed. That is survivable rather than fatal: a wall that cannot be
     * written to the database can still be lit, so the grid stays usable and
     * only saving routes is unavailable.
     *
     * [selectedRouteId] is the saved route being edited, or null for holds that
     * have not been saved as one. Editing a loaded route does not clear it: the
     * edits belong to that route until they are saved over it or saved as a new
     * one, which is what makes "save" mean something different from "save as".
     *
     * [modified] is true when what is on the wall differs from the route it
     * came from, or from nothing at all when no route is open. It is derived
     * by comparing against the route as saved, so undoing an edit back to the
     * original clears it rather than leaving the wall looking dirty forever.
     *
     * [name] is the controller's own name, shown so the top bar says which
     * wall is being controlled. It becomes more than decoration once there is
     * more than one wall to be connected to.
