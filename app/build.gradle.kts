// The release keystore never goes in the repo. On Android the signing
// certificate *is* the app's identity: updates are only accepted if they're
// signed by the same key, so anyone holding it can ship a build that devices
// trust as genuine - and losing it means never being able to update the
// installs already out there.
//
// Credentials come from Gradle properties in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties,
// deliberately outside the project rather than in a gitignored file beside
// it. gitignore only defends against git; a secret inside the project folder
// is still reachable by a zip of the directory, a backup tool pointed at the
// repo, or a stray `git add -f`. Outside the tree none of those touch it.
//
// The same names also work as -P flags or ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_* environment
// variables, so CI needs no separate mechanism. See docs/releasing.md.
//
// Checked as a set rather than just the keystore path. Setting the path but
// leaving a password blank is a mistake that has already happened once here,
// and it surfaces much later as a cryptic "keystore password was incorrect"
// from the packaging task. A blank value counts as missing for that reason.
